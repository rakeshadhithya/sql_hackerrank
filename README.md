# SQL Learning Journey

This repository contains my daily SQL practice as I work through the [HackerRank SQL Track](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql).

## Folder Structure

Solutions are organized by topic:

- `basic_select/`
- `advance_select/`
- `aggregation/`
- `basic_join/`
- `advance_join/`
- `alternative_queries/`

Each file inside is named as:  
`problem-title.sql` â€” lowercase with underscores or hyphens.

### Examples:

- `salary_of_employees.sql`
- `weather_observation_station_1.sql`
