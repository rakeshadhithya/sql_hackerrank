-- two parts: first part where x < y and reverse pair exists. second part: where x = y and appearing at least twice. 
-- union to remove duplicates, finally order by x

ORDER BY X

/*
two parts because two different kinds of symmetry we need to catch. one: where x!=y (x<y) and reverse pair 
exists and two: both values same and when reversed they are indeed the same(appears at least twice so the 
reverse pair exists). union to remove duplicates and combile results
NOTE: you cannot combine <= in first part because youâ€™ll get single (X = Y) pairs even if they occur once
